<h2>What This Guide Covers</h2>

Always confirm version numbers, file sources, permissions, device compatibility and the developer's current terms before installing or using an app.</p>
<h2>Quick Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check the app or game name and developer.</li>
<li>Compare the listed version and file size with the current release.</li>
<li>Review Android compatibility and requested permissions.</li>
<li>Use a trusted source and scan downloaded files before installation.</li>
<li>Read the app's own rules, privacy information and responsible-use guidance.</li>
